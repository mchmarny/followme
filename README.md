# followme

Monitor new Twitter followers/unfollowers across multiple accounts and identify who doesn't follow you back and whom you don't follow back without handing over your entire Twitter account over to another service. 

## Why followme app

While there are a few services available on-line to track your followers and unfollowers, they all tend to require a full write access to your Twitter account, including make changes to your profile and tweet, like, or DM on your behalf. 

followme app requires only read-only access to your Twitter account, uses only public data already available about your account, and keeps your data locally, on your device.
